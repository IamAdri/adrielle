# Adrielle website

## Description
**Adrielle** is a fictiv e-commerce website of women`s shoes. 

This project is a **demo for my portofolio** and it can do the following main tasks:

- **CRUD** actions expected in an e-commerce website: fetch products, add or remove from favorites and cart, write a review or make an order.
- **Supabase** is used for data fetching and manipulation.
- Show and edit **user`s details** such as delivery address, personal orders and reviews.
- Authenticate users with **NextAuth** with **Google Provider**.
- **Save** products from favorites and cart if any of user before he logged in and transfer **to user account**.
- **Light/dark mode**.

## Notes
* Text and images used in this project were created and generated by **ChatGPT** and **OpenArt**.
* As it is a **demo project** for my portofolio, I recommend using **fictiv personal data** such as telephone number and address.

## Reflection
The idea behind this project was to create an website with data created in **Supabase** project and implement functionalities that are widely popular such as adding to **favorites**, making an **order**, **login** etc. 

In order to show my knowledge I`ve gained so far I have decided to create this one with **Next.js** App router. For styling I used **Tailwind** and for authentication the **Next.js Authenticator** with **Google Provider**. 

As my first project created for portofolio it was an amazing way to practice all I`ve learned and to face challenges of a considerably complex website with many components, states and side affects. Some of mostly challenging parts of this experience was to manage global state with **ContextApi** used in many components and to control side affects and errors in different scenarios of interacting with website. Also, something that Next.js brought for me as a difficult task are errors which appeared as a consequence of hydration mismatch during developing stage.
