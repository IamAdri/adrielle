## Reflection
The idea behind this project was to create an website with data created in Supabase project and implement functionalities that are widely popular such as adding to favorites, making an order, login etc. 

In order to show my knowledge I`ve gained so far I have decided to create this one with Next.js App router. For styling I used Tailwind and for authentication the Next.js Authenticator with Google Provider. 

As my first project created for portofolio it was an amazing way to practice all I`ve learned and to face challenges of a considerably complex website with many components, states and side affects. Some of mostly challenging parts of this experience was to manage global state with ContextApi used in many components and to control side affects and errors in different scenarios of interacting with website. Also, something that Next.js brought for me as a difficult task are errors which appeared as a consequence of hydration mismatch during developing stage.
